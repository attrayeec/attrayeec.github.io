The medical device market in India has seen significant growth since the early 2000s, with predictions indicating a promising future. As multinational corporations establish a presence in the market, local companies are expected to follow suit, offering low-cost solutions and customized products tailored to the Indian market. The growth potential is evident, with the Indian medical devices market projected to reach $50 billion by 2030. The government has recognized the sector's importance and has implemented initiatives like the Production Linked Incentive Scheme and the National Medical Devices Policy to support growth and innovation. However, challenges remain, particularly in regulating AI-enabled devices and ensuring equitable access to digital healthcare. As regulations evolve and technology advances, India stands at the forefront of a healthcare revolution, poised to leverage innovation for the benefit of all.
