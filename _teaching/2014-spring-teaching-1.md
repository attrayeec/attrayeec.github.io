Artificial Intelligence (AI) has garnered a lot of interest, with questions on how to build safe and trustworthy AI systems in the healthcare industry. 
What questions do we need to ask about using AI in healthcare? And how do we ask them? What are current regulatory expectations? I will be using examples to explain the 'how' and considerations to be taken into account from a quality and regulatory perspective.

‘Navigating global AI healthcare regulations: current trends and future perspectives’ is designed for undergraduates and graduate students, entrepreneurs (and anyone actually interested in healthcare), where you'll explore how to ask the right questions when developing and deploying AI systems in the healthcare industry to ensure safe and ethical end products.

A number of quizzes and polls, along with a complimentary assignment and evaluation of risk-based assessment of AI systems will help ensure that students understand the key concepts of this course. 

This talk was delivered to 47 participants from various levels of education (undergraduate, graduate, registered nurses, lab professionals) affiliated to various campuses at Northeastern University.
