Artificial Intellgence (AI) is disrupting every market. How are countries across the world regulating (or planning to regulate) it? Join me in discussing an overview of how the World Health Organization (WHO) expects countries, developers, providers and deployers to think about AI governance. I will discuss the most recent global updates on AI regulation in the healthcare industry. Countries like the US, EU, Canada, China, Italy, India, Brazil, Japan, Australia and other nations are going to be covered in this talk. I will also be talking about future trends of nation-specific policies for AI deployed in the healthcare space.
