Over this 1 hour podcast, I discussed topics centered around the medical device design control lifecycle, regulatory and quality expectations of medical device manufacturers, the international regulatory landscape for AI-enabled medical devices and a comparative analysis of the regulatory approach of the US, EU and emerging economies (such as Saudi Arabia and India) towards medical devices. I also discussed the future of the medical device space and shared experiences and insights in developing sound design controls.
