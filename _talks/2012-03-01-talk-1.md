Given the multitude of news articles, blogs, and regulatory announcements capturing the attention of the medical community and the general public regarding off-label use and social media-driven misinformation on Ozempic, we present a comprehensive three-pronged strategy to combat misinformation globally: starting from a grassroot level to a global level. Our aim is to educate patients regarding misinformation, advise prescribers on priority-based prescriptions, and offer creative solutions to combat misinformation. 

Our approach has been distinguished as one of the top three submissions in the US put forth by the student community.
